  <h1>ABOUT</h1>
  
  <div class="about__content">
    <p>This is a brutalist blog built with 11ty. Brutalism in web design is characterized by its raw, utilitarian aesthetic with minimal styling, high contrast, and often unconventional layouts.</p>
    
    <p>The term "brutalism" comes from the French word "brut," meaning "raw," and was originally used to describe a style of architecture that emerged in the 1950s. In web design, brutalism embraces the following principles:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Raw, unfiltered design</li>
      <li>Rejection of user-friendly conventions</li>
      <li>Deliberate lack of refinement</li>
      <li>High contrast and bold typography</li>
      <li>Function over form</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This blog uses these principles to create a distinctive and memorable reading experience.</p>
