description: How to use contrast effectively in brutalist web design.

Contrast is the lifeblood of brutalist design. Unlike the subtle, harmonious contrasts found in mainstream web design, brutalism embraces stark, sometimes jarring visual differences to create impact and direct attention.

## Black and White: The Ultimate Contrast

The foundation of brutalist contrast is often a stark black-and-white palette. This binary approach creates maximum legibility and visual impact.

## Size Contrasts

Brutalist design frequently employs extreme size differences:

- Tiny elements juxtaposed with massive ones
- Disproportionately large headlines
- Unexpected scaling that breaks conventional proportions

This creates visual tension and disrupts the comfortable, predictable flow of traditional interfaces.

## Spacing as Contrast

In brutalist design, white space isn't distributed evenly. Instead, it's used to create deliberate contrasts:

1. Dense clusters of information
2. Vast empty areas
3. Asymmetrical layouts that feel intentionally unbalanced

## Textural Contrasts

Brutalism often mixes:

- Pixel-perfect vector elements
- Low-resolution imagery
- Text-as-image
- Rough, handmade elements

These textural contrasts emphasize the digital medium while rejecting the polished aesthetic of mainstream design.

## Functional Contrast

Beyond visual contrast, brutalism emphasizes functional contrast—making interactive elements stand out not through subtle cues, but through bold, unmistakable visual differences.

```html
<button class="brutalist-button">
  CLICK HERE
</button>

<style>
  .brutalist-button {
    font-family: "Courier New", monospace;
    font-size: 24px;
    padding: 16px 24px;
    background: #000;
    color: #fff;
    border: 0;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: transform 0.1s;
  }
  
  .brutalist-button:hover {
    transform: scale(1.05);
  }
</style>
```

## Conclusion

Contrast in brutalist design isn't subtle—it's a primary design tool used to create impact, direct attention, and reject the homogenized aesthetics of contemporary web design. By embracing stark contrasts in color, size, spacing, and texture, brutalist interfaces create memorable experiences that stand out in a sea of sameness.
