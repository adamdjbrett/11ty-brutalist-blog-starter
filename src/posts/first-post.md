description: Exploring the raw, unfiltered approach to web design through the lens of brutalism.
---

Brutalism in web design is characterized by its raw, unfiltered aesthetic. It's a deliberate rejection of the polished, user-friendly interfaces that dominate the digital landscape today.

## Origins of Brutalism

The term "brutalism" comes from the French word "brut," meaning "raw." It was originally used to describe a style of architecture that emerged in the 1950s, characterized by its use of exposed concrete (béton brut) and functional design.

In web design, brutalism embraces the following principles:

- Raw, unfiltered design
- Rejection of user-friendly conventions
- Deliberate lack of refinement
- High contrast and bold typography
- Function over form

## Why Choose Brutalism?

In an era of cookie-cutter websites and homogenized design patterns, brutalism offers a refreshing alternative. It's a statement against the sanitized, corporate aesthetic that dominates the web.

```css
/* Example of brutalist CSS */
body {
  font-family: "Courier New", monospace;
  max-width: 100%;
  margin: 0;
  background: #fff;
  color: #000;
  border: 8px solid #000;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 4rem;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  letter-spacing: -2px;
  margin: 0;
}
```

## Implementing Brutalist Design

To create a brutalist website, consider the following approaches:

1. **Embrace raw typography:** Use monospace fonts, mix sizes dramatically, and don't be afraid of contrast.
2. **Reject conventional layouts:** Break the grid, overlap elements, and use unconventional spacing.
3. **Use high contrast:** Black and white with occasional primary colors creates the stark contrast characteristic of brutalism.
4. **Expose the structure:** Don't hide the bones of your website—celebrate them.
5. **Be direct and honest:** Brutalism values straightforward communication over marketing polish.

> "Good design is as little design as possible." — Dieter Rams

This quote, while from a minimalist designer, also applies to brutalism's focus on function and honesty.

## Conclusion

Brutalism isn't for every project, but it offers a powerful way to stand out in today's homogenized digital landscape. By embracing raw aesthetics and functional design, brutalist websites create memorable, distinctive experiences that reject the bland conformity of contemporary web design.

Remember: in brutalism, the rawness isn't a bug—it's a feature.
