description: How typography plays a crucial role in brutalist design aesthetics.
---

Typography in brutalist design isn't just about choosing fonts—it's about making a statement. Brutalist typography rejects the soft, friendly approach of modern web design in favor of stark contrasts and raw visual impact.

## Monospace Dominance

Monospace fonts are a brutalist staple. Their uniform character width creates a rigid, mechanical appearance that aligns perfectly with brutalist principles.

```css
pre {
  font-family: "Courier New", monospace;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  padding: 24px;
  overflow-x: auto;
  border: 2px solid #000;
}
```

## Hierarchical Contrast

Brutalist typography often features extreme size contrasts between headings and body text. This creates a visual hierarchy that's impossible to ignore:

- Massive headings (48pt+)
- Standard body text (16pt)
- Tiny footnotes (8pt)

## Technical Aesthetic

The technical, almost "undesigned" look of brutalist typography evokes computer terminals and early digital interfaces. This aesthetic celebrates the digital medium rather than trying to mimic print design.

## Alignment and Spacing

Brutalist typography often uses:

1. Hard left alignment
2. Deliberate use of monospace to create grid-like structures
3. Unconventional spacing that creates tension
4. Lack of hyphenation, allowing lines to break naturally

## Conclusion

Typography in brutalist design isn't an afterthought—it's a core component of the aesthetic. By embracing monospace fonts, extreme contrast, and technical characteristics, brutalist typography creates a distinctive visual language that stands in opposition to the homogenized design trends of the mainstream web.
