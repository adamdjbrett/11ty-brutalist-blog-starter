This is a brutalist blog built with 11ty. Brutalism in web design is characterized by its raw, utilitarian aesthetic with minimal styling, high contrast, and often unconventional layouts.

The term "brutalism" comes from the French word "brut," meaning "raw," and was originally used to describe a style of architecture that emerged in the 1950s. In web design, brutalism embraces the following principles:

+ Raw, unfiltered design
+ Rejection of user-friendly conventions
+ Deliberate lack of refinement
+ High contrast and bold typography
+ Function over form
    
This blog uses these principles to create a distinctive and memorable reading experience.
